The Risk Modeller's Toolkit is currently divided into two sections:
\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Vulnerability} These functions are intended to address the modeller's needs for defining vulnerability curves, implementing methodologies differing for level of complexity and for the input data available for the buildings under study. GEM analytical vulnerability guidelines have been integrated in this tool and some of the methodologies indicated have been already implemented in the library.
\item \textbf{Plotting} These functions are intended to address the needs of visualising the results of the calculations performed with the OpenQuake engine. 
\end{enumerate}
