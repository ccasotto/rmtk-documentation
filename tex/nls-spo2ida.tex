The aim of this procedure is the estimation of the median spectral acceleration value $\hat{S}_{a,ds}$, that brings the structure to the attainment of a set of damage states ds, and the corresponding dispersion beta $\beta_{S_a}$, the parameters needed for the mathematical representation of fragility in equation \ref{eq:fragility-definition}. The aim is achieved making use of the tool spo2ida (Vamvatsikos and Cornell, 2006), where static pushover curves are converted into 16\%, 50\% and 84\% ida curves, using empirical relationships from a large database of incremental dynamic analysis results, as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:spo2ida}.

\end{figure}

The spo2ida-based procedure presented herein is applicable to any kind of multi-linear capacity curve, and it is suitable for single building fragility curve estimation, as described in section \ref{subsubsec:single-building-spo2ida}. However the fragility curves derived for single buildings can be combined in a unique fragility curve, which considers also the inter-building uncertainty, as described in section \ref{subsubsec:multiple-building-spo2ida}.

\subsubsection{Single-building Fragility and Vulnerability function}
\label{subsubsec:single-building-spo2ida}
Given an idealised capacity curve the spo2ida tool uses an implicit R-$\mu$-T relation to correlate nonlinear displacement, expressed in terms of ductility $\mu$ to the corresponding median capacities in terms of the parameters R. R is the lateral strength ratio, defined as the ratio between the spectral acceleration S$_a$ and the yielding capacity of the system S$_{ay}$. \\

Each branch of the capacity curve, hardening, softening and residual plateau, is converted to a corresponding branch of the three ida curves, using the R-$\mu$-T relation, which is a function of the hardening stiffness, the softening stiffness and the residual force. These parameters are derived from the idealised pushover capacity expressed in $\mu$-R terms, as well as the ductility levels at the onset of each branch. If some of the branches of the pushover curve are missing because of the seismic behaviour of the system, spo2ida can equally work with bilinear, trilinear and quadrilinear idealisations.

The result of the spo2ida routine is thus a list of ductility levels and corresponding R values at 50\%, 16\% and 84\% percentiles. The distribution of R values at each ductility level, due to the record-to-record variability, is assumed to be lognormal and it can be easily converted to the dispersion of S$_a$ using equation \ref{eq:betaR}. 
Median R and its dispersion at ductility levels corresponding to the damage thresholds can thus be determined, and $\hat{S}_{a,ds}$ can be extracted simply multiplying $R_{50\% ds}$ by the yielding capacity of the system $S_{ay}$, as shown in eq. \ref{eq:SaR} and eq. \ref{eq:Say}.\\

If dispersion due to uncertainty in the limit state definition $\beta_{\theta c}$ is different from zero a Monte Carlo sampling needs to be performed to combine it with the record-to-record dispersion. Different values of ductility limit state are sampled from the  lognormal distribution with median the median value of the ductility limit state, and dispersion the input $\beta_{\theta c}$. For each of these ductilities the corresponding median $R_{50\%}$ and R$_{16\%}$, R$_{84\%}$ are found and converted into $\hat{S}_{a,ds}$ and $\beta_S_{a d}$ according to equation \ref{eq:SaR} and \ref{eq:betaR}. MC random S$_a$ for each MC sampled ductility limit state are computed, and their median and the dispersion are estimated. These parameters constitute the median $\hat{S}_{a,ds}$ and the total dispersion $\beta_{S_a}$ for the considered damage state. The procedure is repeated for each damage state.\\

To derive a discrete vulnerability function at certain intensity measure levels, the input damage-to-loss factors are applied to the probability of occurance of each damage state, extracted from the probability of exceedance of each damage state described by the set of fragility curves. 

If dispersion due to uncertainty in the limit state is different from zero a vulnerability function is derived for the MC sets of sampled ductility limit states. It results in MC loss ratios (LRs) for each defined intensity measure levels. Finally a lognormal distribution of the loss ratios is assumed at each iml with mean and standard deviation the mean and the standard deviation of all the computed loss ratios.

\subsubsection{Multiple-Building Fragility and Vulnerability function}
\label{subsubsec:multiple-building-spo2ida}
If multiple buildings have been input to derive a set of fragility curves for a class of buildings all $\hat{S}_{a,blg}$ and $\beta_{S_a,blg}$ are combined in a single lognormal curve for each damage state. A minimum of 5 buildings should be considered to obtain reliable results for the class. The procedure to get $\mu_{S_a,tot}$ and $cov_{S_a,tot}$ for the class of building is the same described in section \ref{subsubsec:multiple-buildings}.

A vulnerability curve for the class of buildings can also be obtained, from the single building vulnerability curves, as described in section \ref{subsubsec:multiple-buildings}.

\subsubsection{Inputs}
\label{subsubsec:InputSpo2ida}
The inputs must be formatted as comma-separated value files (.csv), and saved in the folder \textit{input}, contained in the NSP directory. If any other environment different from Windows is used make sure that the "comma separated values Windows" is selected as saving option when creating the input files. 

If multiple buildings want to be analysed to consider the inter-building uncertainty the parameters relative to each building should be added as additional lines in the tables, as shown in the examples below, otherwise a single line must be input.

If the user has already at disposal an idealised multilinear pushover curve for each building, that is to say that the variable \textit{in\_type} has been set to 0, the following data need to be provided in the corresponding csv files:

\begin{enumerate}
\item First period of vibration $T_1$, corresponding modal participation factor $\Gamma_1$, normalised with respect to the roof displacement, and weight for the combination of different buildings, input in \textit{building\_parameters.csv}, as in section \ref{subsubsec:InputCr}, input n. 1.
	
\item Top displacement at each damage state threshold and corresponding dispersion $\beta_{\theta c}$ input in \textit{displacement\_profile.csv}, as in section \ref{subsubsec:InputCr}, input n. 2. 
	
\item Idealised pushover curve, input in \textit{idealised\_curve.csv} as shown below. The parameters needed to describe the idealised pushover curve are: yielding displacement d$_y$, displacement at the onset of degradation d$_s$, displacement at the onset of residual force d$_{min}$, ultimate displacement d$_u$, maximum force F$_{max}$, residual force F$_{min}$. These parameters are represented in Figure~\ref{fig:quadrilinear}.

\begin{figure}[!htbp]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=10cm]{./figures/quadrilinear.jpg}
\caption{Idealisation of capacity curve using multilinear elasto-plastic form.}
\label{fig:quadrilinear}
\end{figure}

\begin{table}[!htbp]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|} \hline
\textbf{n.building} & \textbf{d$_y$} & \textbf{d$_s$} & \textbf{d$_{min}$} & \textbf{d$_u$} & \textbf{F$_{max}$} & \textbf{F$_{min}$} \\ \hline
1 & 0.09	& 0.3	& 0.4 & 0.5 & 523 & 430\\ \hline
2 & 0.12	& 0.35	 & 0.43 & 0.5 & 400 & 305\\ \hline	
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\item Consequence model (loss ratio per each damage state) consistent with the defined set of damage states, input in \textit{consequence.csv}, as in section \ref{subsubsec:InputCr}, input n. 5.
	
\end{enumerate}

If these data are not available, \textit{in\_type} = 0 can be selected and the "raw" results from a pushover analysis can be input instead. The same data as in section \ref{subsubsec:InputCr} for \textit{in\_type} = 0 can be input.

\subsubsection{Calculation Steps}
The overall workflow of spo2ida-based procedure is summarised in this section and represented in Figure \ref{fig:SPO_workflow} for the case of a single building fragility/vulnerability function. 

\begin{figure}[!htbp]

\label{fig:SPO_workflow}
\end{figure}

The option \textit{an\_type} must be set equal to 1 and the option \textit{in\_type} according to the input at disposal. The corresponding inputs should follow the requirements described in section \ref{subsubsec:InputSpo2ida}. Given these options the code proceeds with the following steps:\\

\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Process Inputs within \textit{read\_data}  function}\\
\begin{enumerate}
\item If \textit{in\_type} = 0, the roof displacement at each limit state and the idealised pushover curve parameters are extracted from \textit{displacement\_profile.csv} and \textit{idealised\_curve.csv} respectively. A one-to-one relationship between roof displacement and drift is assumed.

\item If \textit{in\_type} = 1 the results from a pushover analysis are extracted from \textit{displacements\_pushover.csv} and \textit{reactions\_pushover.csv} and drift limit states from {limits.csv}. The relationship between drift and roof displacement is given by the pushover inputs. The idealised pushover curve is then derived in the \textit{idealisation} function, where the idealisation process is conducted according to the Gem Analytical Vulnerability Guidelines.\\	\end{enumerate}

Period, modal participation factor, number of buildings constituting the building class, importance factor (weight) of the each building within the class, average period of the class and $S_a(T_{av})/S_a(T_{blg})$ ratio are also returned by the function \textit{read\_data} .\\

\item \textbf{Fragility curve methodology}\\
The parameters extracted are used in the \textit{spo2ida\_method} function, within the \textit{fragility\_process} function, to derive ductility levels $\mu_{ds}$, median spectral acceleration $\hat{S}_{a,ds}$ and the total dispersion $\beta_{S_a}$ at each limit state through the following steps:

\begin{enumerate}

\item The idealised MDoF system is transformed into an equivalent SDoF system, using $\Gamma_1$, and the SDoF capacity curve is  expressed in terms of $\mu$-R.

\item Ductility levels $\mu_{ds}$ corresponding to each damage threshold, are defined.

\item The input variables for spo2ida tool are extracted from the capacity curve and they are used as input to get the 16\%-50\%-84\% ida curves.

\item R$_{50\%}$, R$_{16\%}$ and R$_{84\%}$ are computed for the ductility limit states $\mu_{ds}$, interpolating the aforementioned curves.

\item $\hat{S}_{a,ds}$ and the corresponding dispersion $\beta_{S_{a d}}$ due to record-to-record variability are computed using eq. \ref{eq:SaR} and \ref{eq:betaR} for each limit state.

\item If dispersion due to uncertainty in the limit state $\beta_{\theta c}$ is different from zero, different ductility limit states are sampled for each median ductility level $\mu_{ds}$. For each sampled ductilities the corresponding $\hat{S}_{a,ds}$ and $\beta_{S_{a ds}}$ are found as described in steps (d) and (e), and MC random S$_a$ for each of the MC sampled ductility limit states are computed using $\hat{S}_{a,ds}$ and $\beta_{S_{a d}}$.\\

\end{enumerate}

\item \textbf{Fragility curve results}\\
If number of buildings = 1\\
\begin{enumerate}
\item If \textit{vuln} = 0
the final values of median and dispersion of the fragility curves, $\hat{S}_{a,ds}$ and $\beta_{S_a}$, are computed as the mean and the standard deviation of the MC$^2$ samples of S$_a$, if many $\mu_{ds}$ were sampled at step 2.f, otherwise they correspond to the $\hat{S}_{a,ds}$ and $\beta_{S_{a d}}$, including only record-to-record variability, obtained at step 2.e.
All median values of $S_{a, ds}$ are converted to mean values $\mu_{ln(S_{a, ds})}$; mean $\mu_{ln(S_{a})}$ and total dispersion $\beta_{S_a}$ are then converted to logarithmic mean $\mu_{S_a}$ and logarithmic covariance $cov_{S_a}$, according to equations \ref{eq:median-to-mean} and \ref{eq:dispersion-to-standard} respectively.
Fragility curves for the building are displayed if the variable \textit{plotflag}[2] = 1, and logarithmic $\mu_{S_a}$ and $cov_{S_a}$ are exported in the \textit{outputs} folder.

\item 
If \textit{vuln} =1 if many values were sampled to account for uncertainty in the damage criteria at step 2.f, MC values of loss ratio LRs are defined for the MC sets of $\mu_{ds}$, using the \textit{damage\_to\_loss} function, for each intensity measure level defined in the variable \textit{iml}. Mean and standard deviation of LRs(iml), $\mu_{LR}$ and $\beta_{LR}$, are computed. If $\beta_{\theta c}$= 0 a single set of $\mu_{ds}$ is considered, resulting in no uncertainty in the LR for each iml.
Vulnerability curve for the building is displayed if the variable \textit{plotflag}[3] = 1, and $\mu_{LR}$ and $cov_{LR}$ at each iml are exported in the \textit{outputs} folder.\\

\end{enumerate}

If number of buildings > 1\\
\begin{enumerate}
\item If \textit{vuln} = 0
the final values of median and dispersion of the fragility curves, $\hat{S}_{a,ds}$ and $\beta_{S_a}$, are computed as the mean and the standard deviation of the MC$^2$ samples of S$_a$, if many $\mu_{ds}$ were sampled at step 2.f, otherwise they correspond to the $\hat{S}_{a,ds}$ and $\beta_{S_{a d}}$, including only record-to-record variability, obtained at step 2.e.
All $\hat{S}_{a, ds, blg}(T_1)$ are converted to mean values $\mu_{ln(S_{a, ds, blg})}(T_1)$ and then to the intensity measure in common with the rest of the buildings, $\mu_{ln(S_{a, ds, blg}(T_{av}))}$, according to eq. \ref{eq:Sa(Tav)}.\\
The $\mu_{ln(S_{a, ds, blg}(T_{av}))}$ are finally combined in a single lognormal curve for the building class, as described in section \ref{subsubsec:multiple-buildings}. 

Mean $\mu_{ln(S_{a})}$ and total dispersion $\beta_{S_a}$ are then converted to logarithmic mean $\mu_{S_a}$ and logarithmic covariance $cov_{S_a}$, according to equations \ref{eq:median-to-mean} and \ref{eq:dispersion-to-standard} respectively.

Fragility curves for the class of buildings are displayed if the variable \textit{plotflag}[2] = 1, and logarithmic $\mu_{S_a}$ and $cov_{S_a}$ are exported in the \textit{outputs} folder.

\item If \textit{vuln} =1
all $\hat{S}_{a, ds}(T_1)$ for each building are converted to mean $\mu_{ln(S_{a, ds})}(T_1)$ and then to the intensity measure in common with the rest of the buildings, $\mu_{ln(S_{a, ds, blg}(T_{av}))}$, according to eq. \ref{eq:Sa(Tav)}.

if many values were sampled to account for uncertainty in the damage criteria at step 2.f, MC values of loss ratio LRs are defined for the MC sets of $\mu_{ds}$, using the \textit{damage\_to\_loss} function, for each intensity measure level defined in the variable \textit{iml} . Mean and standard deviation of LRs(iml), $\mu_{LR}$ and $\beta_{LR}$, are computed. If $\beta_{\theta c}$= 0 a single set of $\mu_{ds}$ is considered, resulting in no uncertainty in the LR for each iml.
The $\mu_{LR, iml, blg}$ are finally combined in a single mean and standard deviations, as described in section \ref{subsubsec:multiple-buildings}. Vulnerability curve for the class of buildings is displayed if the variable \textit{plotflag}[3] = 1, and $\mu_{LR}$ and $cov_{LR}$ at each iml are exported in the \textit{outputs} folder.
